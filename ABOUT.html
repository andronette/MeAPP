        I am Andronette Sanelisekile Leketa originated from Cape Town since i was born and raised in the city, on the 29th of August 1999 on the very stormy day, my mother says. "It was very windy, and there was a big storm when you were comin gon Earth. It was a significance of a Queen born, as the nature was bowing and accepting the shining star on Earth."
        My aim was to study further, but plans were ruined since I had to take care of my sick grandmother. I stayed at home for 2 years not seeing anything progressing in my life, until I was given an opportunity to do what I ever wanted,IT, in a company called CapaCiti. I am still taking my family name far.You know me, you know the Leketa Legacy.
